# Jormungandr Testnets

Here are the different available testnet information and deployments. The idea is to
run public testnets in a timely and efficient way.

# Introduction

We are trying to run the following kind of testnet deployment:

* `stable`: a testnet is qualified **stable** if we do not intent to reset it for some time.
  Please note that we may still need to reset it if needs be.
* `nightly`: a testnet utilizing latest available features, or new parameter settings we want
  to try. You can connect, but beware it may not live long or be of good use.

## What's running at the moment
